# Introduction to Docker

Docker is a containerization technology that provides a simple way to run applications in a container.

What does this mean?

When we run our application on our computer, we are subject to the environment that is running the application.

When we run our application on a container, we are isolated from the environment that is running the application. It will only ever has what is in the container definition and what is copied and pasted into the container as we build it.

As long as you are running the container, you can run your application.

Docker is the technology that allows you to run your application in a container.

WHen we build applications in containers, we allow ourselves to run the application without having to install anything on our computer.

This repo will show you how to build a simple application in a container.
